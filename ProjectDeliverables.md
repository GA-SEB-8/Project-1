## Project planning deliverable

Planning is vital to build anything more than the most trivial of applications; therefore, this is where you will begin your journey with this project. You shouldn't write any code or set up a GitHub repo for your project until an instructor approves your planning materials.

### Details

You will submit the following details about your project for approval by your instructor:

- Your choice of game.
- Pseudocode for the overall gameplay. This pseudocode does not need to go into exhaustive detail but should demonstrate that you understand some of the unique challenges you will encounter while building your game.
- Any additional project planning requirements specific to the game you have chosen as defined in the in the **Additional Planning Requirements** column of the table in the **Recommended games** document or as discussed with your instructor.

## GitHub repo deliverable

After your project proposal has been approved, you'll need to set up a GitHub repo for your project.

> ðŸš¨ As a reminder, you should use the same repo or keep all the repos you use for the entire duration of your project to meet the project requirements.

## Deployed app deliverable

During project week, you'll deploy your project so that others are able to play it on the internet! Follow the [GitHub Pages Deployment guide](https://pages.git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/universal-resources/deployment/github-pages-deployment-for-static-sites/) to deploy your project.
