# Project 1 - Browser Based Game

## Notes and guidance

### Getting started

Here are some quick tips to get your project started:

- Discuss your app idea with an instructor to get feedback before you dive too deep into planning.
- ***Keep it simple.*** Minimum Viable Product (MVP) functionality that looks great and works well is better than extra functionality added to a game without polish.
- Theme your game to give it a personal touch.
- Develop features in a way that allows you to test as you go - try your best to follow the flow of data through your app.
- Regularly review the project requirements to ensure you're on track to pass the project. A printable version of the project requirements can be found [here](../project-requirements/assets/project-requirements.pdf).
- If you're unsure how to begin planning, check out the [Planning Your Browser Game](https://pages.git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/universal-resources/planning-your-browser-game.html) resource.
- If you're unsure how to start coding, check out the [Build a Browser Game Walkthrough](https://pages.git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/universal-resources/build-a-browser-game-walkthrough.html).
- Add comments to your code where it makes sense to do so. Most code is self-documenting, and you shouldn't add comments explaining the obvious. Ideally, comments should explain the ***why*** of code where it's necessary.

### Project assistance

Your instructor team will provide guidelines for reaching out for help during project week.

### Level up ðŸš€

Have you finished your project? Here are some ideas to level it up:

- Add a light/dark mode.
- Add fun extras like showing confetti on a win.
- Add audio details.
- Add animations.
- Add a computer player.
- Store data on the client machine using `localStorage`.

## Presentation ideas

You will have a maximum of 5 minutes to present your project. While the structure and content of your presentation are ultimately up to you, here are some potential ideas and topics to cover:

- Discuss the game. Including details about why you chose the game is a nice touch.
- Play the game! Demo a win or loss.
- Briefly show off something unique in your code or a piece of code you're particularly proud of.
- Share your experience with the project - what was challenging, what did you gain from building this project?
